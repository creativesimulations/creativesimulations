- Hi! My name is Yehoshua Kadosh. I'm a passionate, driven and reliable programmer with a wide range of abilities. specializing in C# programming I am very dedicated to fullfilling
- my dream of becomming a game/app developer.
- Over the course of the past 2 years working with Unity and other personal projects I have learned many different skills including; the Unity game engine, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, Photoshop,
- Blender and Davinci Resolve. Although I love to program, I also have a lot of fun creating simple assets in Blender!
- 
- Right now I am working hard to develop my programming skills further in order to get an entry-level job developing games or Android apps. Although this comes with many challenges, I am VERY driven to succeed!
- I just finished refactoring a mobile game that I made a littel while back because my code was so bad when I first starting learning C# and Unity.. But I'm very happy with the results:)
- Now that I've finished with that project, I'm starting on making short videos of space scenes in Unity. It should be a lot of fun and I hope to putting up a video every two weeks or so.
